      CRITICAL FORMATTING FOR EMAIL RENDERING:
      - Each paragraph MUST be separated by EXACTLY TWO newlines (\\n\\n)
      - Write complete thoughts in each paragraph (3-5 sentences)
      - Use natural paragraph breaks at logical points
      - NO markdown headers (avoid # symbols) - use descriptive text instead
      - Structure content with clear topic transitions
      
      CONTENT STRUCTURE (800-1000 words):
      
      Start with an engaging opening paragraph about ${topic}. Make this 4-5 sentences that hook the reader and introduce the main concept. This should create immediate interest and curiosity about the topic.

      Write a second paragraph explaining why this topic matters right now. Include 3-4 sentences about current trends, relevance, and why people need this information today.

      Create a paragraph about the main problem people face with ${topic}. This should be 4-5 sentences describing the primary challenge, why it's difficult, and how it affects people's lives.

      Write another paragraph covering the solution approach. Explain in 4-5 sentences what works, why it's effective, and how it differs from common approaches that don't work.

      Add a paragraph with specific benefits and advantages. Use 3-4 sentences to highlight the key advantages, including any measurable results or improvements people can expect.

      Include a paragraph with actionable steps or practical advice. Write 4-5 sentences giving readers concrete things they can do to implement this information.

      Create a paragraph with examples, case studies, or real-world applications. Use 3-4 sentences to provide specific examples that illustrate the concepts in action.

      Write a paragraph addressing common mistakes or pitfalls to avoid. Include 3-4 sentences about what not to do and why these mistakes happen.

      End with a strong closing paragraph that encourages action. Use 4-5 sentences to motivate readers, summarize key points, and create a call to action.

      FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:
      - Use the keyword "${topic}" naturally 6-8 times throughout  
      - Each paragraph should be 3-5 complete sentences
      - Separate ALL paragraphs with double newlines (\\n\\n)
      - Write in conversational, engaging tone
      - NO special formatting symbols or markdown
      - Focus on readability and natural flow`
